  symptom: "gNB failed to recognize the configured ciphering algorithm ('nea4'), resulting in security module initialization error and potential connection failure with UE."

    1. Supported ciphering algorithms:
      - nea0 (no encryption)
      - nea1 (based on SNOW 3G)
      - nea2 (based on AES)
      - nea3 (based on ZUC)
    2. It is recommended to use 'nea0' (no encryption) first to simplify initial debugging and avoid security negotiation failures.
    3. Preferred ciphering algorithms the first one of the list that an UE supports in chosen : Valid values: nia0, nia1, nia2, nia3

    4. The integrity_algorithms parameter supports configuring multiple algorithms as a list, for example: ("nia2", "nia1", "nia3", "nia0"). During security negotiation, the gNB will select the first algorithm from the list that is also supported by the UE.

- stage: fh_setup
  symptom: "PCAP file contains zero packets, likely due to incorrect MAC address configuration"
  log_snippet: "[FH] No packets captured â€“ possible mismatch in MAC address between DU and RU"

  notes:
      - "Ensure that the DU and RU MAC addresses are correctly configured and match each other to enable successful packet capture."

- stage: fh_setup
  symptom: "DU reports continuous 'Received Time doesn't correspond to the time we think it is' and 'Jump in frame counter' errors after XRAN start. Observed mismatch between expected and received frame/slot numbers and frequent double sync detection."
  log_snippet: "[PHY]   Jump in frame counter last_frame 86 => 167, slot 19; [PHY]   Received Time doesn't correspond to the time we think it is (slot mismatch, received 167.19, expected 86.11); [PHY]   Detected double sync message 371.6 => 371.7"
